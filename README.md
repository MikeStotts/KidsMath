# Kids Math - Practice Grade School Arithmetic Problems

This was a project in Introduction to Web Programming.

The purpose of the project is to create a web page that will present
practice arithmetic problems suitable for grade schoolers.

Notable requirements:

* The practice exercise was to be started on one server (admiral) but
was then transferred to a second server (hoare).

* Provide a simple login/registration process. Security was not a
concern. Registered login names and passwords were to stored in a simple
text file (no SQL database).

* Multiple attempts be allowed for each problem. This is a practice
exercise, not a test.

* A answer would be counted as wrong only if the student gives up on the question.

* A running score of right answers and attempted problems is kept

* Once a student has decided they have had enough practice, a record of
the final score is written to a text file.

During the project, the instructor decided that division problems would
be too difficult target audience. The division problem code has been
commented out in the source.

URLs for the two servers are hard-coded.
