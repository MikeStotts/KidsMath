# Kids Math - Practice Grade School Arithmatice Problems

This was a project in Introduction to Web Programming.

The purpose of the project is to create a web page that will present
practice arithmatic problems suitable for grade schoolers.

Notable requirements:

<ol>
<li>The practice exercise was to be started on one server (admiral) but
was then transferred to a second server (hoare).</li>

<li>Provide a simple login/registeration process. Seccurity was not a
concern. Registered login names and passwords were to stored in a simple
text file (no sql database).</li>

<li> Multiple attempts be allowed for each problem. This is a practice
exercise, not a test.</li>

* A amswer would be counted as wrong only if the student gives up on the question.

* A running score of right answers and attempted problems is kept

* Once a student has decided they have had enough practice, a record of
the final score is written to a text file.

During the project, the instructor decided that division problems would
be too difficult target audience. The division problrm code has b een
commented out in the source.

URLs for the two servers are hardcoded.
